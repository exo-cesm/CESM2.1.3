# O2 analogues case descriptions
We define O2 analogues as Earth-like planets that have an oxygenated atmosphere.

Simulations between 1000 times less than the present atmospheric level (PAL) of oxygen (the present atmospheric level of O2 is 21% by volume) and up to 1.5 times PAL are included in this definition.

The simulations that have been performed are detailed in the table below:
