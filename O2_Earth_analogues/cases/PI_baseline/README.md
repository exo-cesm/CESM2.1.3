# Case setup instructions

This is the pre-industrial baseline.

No changes were made to the standard BWma1850 case. The resolution used was 2.5 by 1.875 degrees (f19_g17)

Case setup command:
./create_newcase --compset BWma1850 --res f19_g17 --case ~/b.e21.BWma1850.f19_g17.baseline.001 --run-unsupported

## Updated Schumann-Runge band absorption

If you want to be consistent across all cases, make sure to run the case with the updated source modifications.
