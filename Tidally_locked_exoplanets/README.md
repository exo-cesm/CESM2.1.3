# Tidally locked case decriptions
Tidally lokced exoplanets are exoplanets that synchronously rotate around their host star, meaning their orbital period is the same as their rotational period. This is even expected to happen to potentially habiatble exoplanets around M dwarf stars and some K dwarf stars. These exoplanets are epected to have a zero (or near zero) orbital eccentrity and obliquity (axial tilt).

In each case, the obliquity and eccentricty in the model have been set to 0, and the solar zenith angles have been fixed so that the star is fixed in the sky. 

The simulations that have been performed are detailed in the table below:

| Simulation name | Stellar spectrum used   | Total irradiance [Wm<sup>-3</sup>] | Sub stellar point                    | 
| --------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| x name          | x spectrum [cite source]| x                                  | 180&deg;  longitude (Pacific ocean) |
| x name          | x spectrum [cite source]| x                                  | 30&deg; longitude (Africa) |


## Changing the stellar spectrum

We used the [SWIM](https://github.com/jack-eddy-symposium/exoplanetary-impact/tree/main/SWIM) code to change the stellar spectrum and rescale it to specific exoplanets.

## Initial conditions and getting through model crashes

## Location of restart files

Restart files are currently located on ARC4, the supercomputer at the University of Leeds.
