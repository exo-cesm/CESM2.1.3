This is the repository for projects in the "(Exo)Planetary Atmosphere: the Impact of Stars and Solar Physics on Habitability and Life" for the 3rd Jack Eddy Symposium ([https://cpaess.ucar.edu/meetings/eddy-symposium-2022](https://cpaess.ucar.edu/meetings/eddy-symposium-2022)) which took place between the 6<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> June 2022. 

This repository contains the code modifications necessary for simulating exoplanets with CESM2.1.3.

It details how to set up simulations, why the changes were made, as well as problems that were encountered.

Namelist file changes, boundary conditions, solar spectra input files, and source code modifications will be given.

The location of restarts directories will also be given.
