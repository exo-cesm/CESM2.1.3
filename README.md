# Code modifications in CESM2.1.3 for exoplanet simulations and varied oxygen simulations

This repository contains the code modifications necessary for simulating plaeoclimates and exoplanets with CESM2.1.3.

It details how to set up simulations, why the changes were made, as well as problems that were encountered.

Namelist file changes, boundary conditions, solar spectra input files, and source code modifications will be given.

The location of restarts directories will also be given and are currently on the ARC4 supercomuter at the University of Leeds.
